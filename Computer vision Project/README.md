•CONTEXT: University  X  is  currently  undergoing  some  research  involving  understanding  the  characteristics  of plant  and  plant  seedlings  at  various  stages  of  growth.  They  already  have  have  invested  on  curating  sample images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo

•DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images from 12 plant species. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data

•PROJECT  OBJECTIVE: University’s  management  require  an  automation  which  can  create  a  classifier  capable  of determining a plant's species from a photo

**PART1**
=======
•CONTEXT: Company X owns a movie application and repository which caters movie streaming to millions of users who on subscription basis. Company  wants  to  automate  the  process  of  cast  and  crew  information  in  each  scene  from  a  movie  such  that  when  a  user  pauses  on  the movie and clicks on cast information button, the app will show details of the actor in the scene. Company has an in-house computer vision and multimedia experts who need to detect faces from screen shots from the movie scene.

•DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images and its mask where there is a human face.

•PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Face detection from training images.

**PART2**
=======

•CONTEXT: Company X intends to build a face identi!ication model to recognise human faces.•DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images and its mask where there is a human face.

•PROJECT  OBJECTIVE: Face  Aligned  Face  Dataset  from  Pinterest.  This  dataset  contains  10,770  images  for  100  people.  All  images  are  taken from 'Pinterest' and aligned using dlib library.

•TASK: In  this  problem,  we  use  a  pre-trained  model  trained  on  Face  recognition  to  recognise  similar  faces.  Here,  we  are  particularly interested in recognising whether two given faces are of the same person or not.
