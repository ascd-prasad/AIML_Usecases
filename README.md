#### Feature Engineering & Model Tuning
```
The project was accomplished by employing supervised learning, ensemble modelling and unsupervised learning techniques 
to build and train a prediction model to identify Pass/Fail yield of a particular process entity for a semiconductor 
manufacturing company. This projects helps to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the 
process and will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learning and reduce the per unit production costs.
